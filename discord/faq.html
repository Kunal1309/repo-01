                        <p class="question">What does "TOP" mean?</p>
                        <p class="ans">"TOP" is the abbreviation of "The Odin Project".</p>

                        <p class="question">Can TOP help get me a job?</p>
                        <p class="ans">We do not offer job services, however, completing TOP means you have the skills and qualifications to find a job, see getting-hired and the getting hired section of the curriculum. odin-success-stories are also a good source of motivation.</p>
                    </section>

                        <p class="question">Does TOP give certificates?</p>
                        <p class="ans">No, certificates do not have much value outside of very small niches in IT that require certifications, which are usually not programming. After completing TOP, your portfolio should speak for itself.</p>

                        <p class="question">When should I use ModMail?</p>
                        <p class="ans">If you see anything in the server that you believe is against our community rules, we encourage you to send a DM to @ModMail and to not address the issue yourself. You can also send a DM to @ModMail if you're not sure if you're allowed to share something in our channels.</p>

                        <p class="ans">Please don't use @ModMail for personal TOP advice, programming help or casual chats with the team.</p>

                        <p class="ans">Almost always no. Do not assume you have permission. We may entertain things that are not designed to make money or take away from the mission of TOP. Please ask us in a DM to @ModMail.</p>

                        <p class="ans">There is no data on this information, between 3 months and 3 years seems to be the range. More info <a href="#">here</a>.</p>

                        <p class="ans">Thinkful pays for the domain and servers, it was part of the deal when Erik sold Viking Code School to Thinkful. They don't ask us for anything in return except a small ad on the site. They do not use our curriculum, nor do they contribute to ours. TOP is fully run by the Core and Maintainer teams, as well as other contributors on a volunteer basis.</p>

                        <p class="question">Which path should I take? / What language should I learn?</p>
                        <p class="ans">It doesn't matter, though there's more information at the end of Foundations. Don't worry until you have completed Foundations. See above.</p>

                        <p class="question">In what order should I take the courses of the curriculum?</p>
                        <p class="ans">You should start at the beginning and not skip, even if you feel you are experienced. Part of what makes TOP work is building on previous knowledge in the curriculum. If you know the stuff, it will go quickly, if you do not, you'll be glad you did it. TOP expects you to have gone through the previous sections before each next section. This is a curriculum, not a collection of tutorials.</p>

                        <p class="ans">Generally no, however a degree can help you get past some non-understanding HR people. Many people have become successful without them, see odin-success-stories.</p>
